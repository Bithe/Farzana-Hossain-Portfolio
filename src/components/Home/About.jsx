          I am a graduate with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering
          from State University of Bangladesh, currently in the learning phase
          and actively seeking an internship to enhance my skills in web and
          mobile application development. Although I do not have professional
          experience, I am proficient in JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, and
          have completed personal projects that demonstrate my
          capabilities and commitment. I am eager to learn from experienced
          professionals and contribute to innovative projects, aiming to build
          a solid foundation for a successful career in software development.
